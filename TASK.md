# Coding Challenge

Your task is to build a [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
API backend application that can be used to manage personal notes in a __multi-user
environment__.


## Requirements

The API must have the following key features:

1. Support multiple users
1. Save a new note
1. Update a previously saved note
1. Delete a saved note
1. Archive a note
1. Unarchive a previously archived note
1. List saved notes that aren't archived
1. List notes that are archived  


You are free to use a technology stack of your choice to build the application. If
you aren't familiar with building backend REST APIs, you can find a collection of
examples at https://www.todobackend.com (Please note we are not advocating any method
used in these examples).


## What we are looking for

1. Completeness of the API (at a minimum the API should be functionally complete to
meet the requirements mentioned above)
1. Good coding practices (e.g. easy to read and manageable code, adding test cases etc.)
1. Use of industry best practices


If you think there should be other features not mentioned but required or good to have,
you are free to add those features.  

The API you create will be used by a UX team as the backend for a Personal Notes
application they building, consider how you would communicate your API details
with the UX team.  

There's no time limit for this task but we don't expect you to spend more than a few hours.  

Please use this github repo to commit your changes, and let us know via email when your code is ready to be reviewed.  

Once complete, save a README.md file with your code which should include:

1. How to run your application
1. Instructions to the UX team (i.e. how to use your API)
1. Your choice of technology and the reasons for using them (and any alternatives
you considered)
1. If you were to spend more time on this task, what would you change and what other
key features would you add.
